# PersonalWebsite

My personal website using Angular JS, TailwindCSS, ThreeJs and Firebase to deploy. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to developer Julien ThÃªme for his amazing project, which served as a great inspiration for my own work. All credit goes to him for the original concept and idea. You can check out his GitHub here: https://github.com/ZIRTR0X. Thank you, Julien!

`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/styles.css --watch`
